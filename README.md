Guan is currently researching extreme weather and climate events, e.g., droughts, heatwaves, floods, and atmospheric rivers. Guan use machine learning, climate networks (CN), and lagrangian methods for the mechanistic analysis and event prediction of these events. My interests include the intersection of multidisciplinary of ACC detection and attribution (i.e., AI & CN coupled model, moisture & heat tracking, and compound extreme hydrological and meteorological disasters).
